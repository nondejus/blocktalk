[Burstcoin](https://www.burst-coin.org/) was the world's first HDD-mined
cryptocurrency using an energy efficient
and fair Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus algorithm.

It was also the first to implement a turing-complete [smart contract](https://www.burst-coin.org/smart-contracts)
system in the form of *Automated Transactions* (AT), as specified by [CIYAM](http://ciyam.org/at/).
However, before BlockTalk, the creation and deployment of smart contracts required writing
(assembler-like) bytecode and testing on-chain, making the development of contracts cumbersome.

This project allows the user to write, debug, and deploy Burst smart contracts relying only on Java.
You can use a simple text editor or your preferred IDE.
BlockTalk consists of the following key components:
 - **[Contract.java](src/main/java/bt/Contract.java)**: a Java abstract class defining the basic API available for contracts
 - **Emulator**: an emulated blockchain and respective UI
 - **Compiler**: a system to convert Java bytecode into Burst AT bytecode that can run on the Burst blockchain

This project is in **alpha** stage. Most contracts can be compiled into CIYAM bytecode.
However, please carefully inspect your compiled AT contracts and
test it exhaustively on the [testnet](https://burstwiki.org/wiki/Testnet) before production.


## Sample Contracts
Take a look on the [samples source folder](src/main/java/bt/sample/).

## Using (write your own contract)

### Sample application
The easiest way to start with BlockTalk is to clone the [blocktalk-sample](https://github.com/jjos2372/blocktalk-sample).
This sample application is actually a [VSCode Java Application](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
Just clone or download the sample application and open its folder with VSCode.

### Manually add BlockTalk to your gradle project
Add the following to your gradle.build file:
```
repositories {
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.jjos2372:blocktalk:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

### Manually add BlockTalk to your maven project
Add the repository to your configuration:
```
<repositories>
	<repository>
	    <id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.jjos2372</groupId>
	<artifactId>blocktalk</artifactId>
	<version>-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
